# Curriculum Review
### GH Junior Phase Review

In this short-answer self-assessment, we've compiled a comprehensive list of the subject matter covered so far. Think of it as a study aid.

We do not expect you to have all of the answers off the top of your head—the point of this assessment isn't that you get everything correct, but that both you and we are aware of what particular areas we should help you out with.

We ask that you at least look at every question, but we do not require that you answer them. In fact, we recommend that you answer only the questions you find difficult.

There are a lot of questions, and we recommend that you start by going quickly through all of them and making note of subjects or questions you find challenging. During review week, you can use this as a kind-of check list—answering each question as you review its topic.
